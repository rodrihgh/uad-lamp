# What is this?

Implementation of the networks in the paper
[AMP-Inspired Deep Networks for Sparse Linear Inverse Problems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7934066/)

[Schniter](http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~schniter)
, and [Sundeep Rangan](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/sundeep-rangan)
published in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

The original implementation can be found in the repository
[onsager_deep_learning](https://github.com/mborgerding/onsager_deep_learning).

This code was implemented to test the approach from the cited paper in the problem
of mobile user activity detection using complex fading values.
